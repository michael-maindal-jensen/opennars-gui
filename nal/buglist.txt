I get:
Solved <(&/,<a --> 3>,+3) =/> <a --> 4>>. %1.00;0.31%
which shouldn't happen because it should not unify #wat with 4 because its not a query variable

I get nothing, altough the solution should be:

Solved <(&/,<a --> 3>,+3) =/> <a --> 4>>. %1.00;0.31%

because ?wat can be unified with 4 since ?wat is a query variable

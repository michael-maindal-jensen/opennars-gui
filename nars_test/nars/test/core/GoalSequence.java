/**
I played a lot with 1.6.0 version for long time now. I'm am pleased that it works that nicely.

However I found one thing which I think is crucial to make it more effective.

Lets say we have a sequence of actions which leads to a goal, like "(&/,a,b,c) =/> d" with the goal "d!".
We currently don't create such statements by temporal induction, which currently means it will be like that:

a =/> b
b =/> c
c =/> d

with d being the goal,
it will spawn c,
then spawn b,
then spawn a with even less priority,
now it will eventually execute a.

However, this is very ineffective, because it has to do every step "mentally", with a ton of reasoning-overhead,
which leads, altough working in principial, to failing even for relatively simple examples.

Clearly with expressions like (&/,a,b,c), the execution could be achieved with much less reasoning overhead for the system,
it may work much better then.

Any ideas of a strategy to generate statements like "(&/,a,b,c) =/> d" with temporal induction in an effective way?

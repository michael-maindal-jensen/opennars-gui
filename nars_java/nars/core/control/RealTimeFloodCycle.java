/**
 *
 * From: tony_lofthouse@btinternet.com  *
 * Concepts are defined as agents, so can run in parallel. To keep the number of
 * ‘active’ agents manageable I do a few things; 1) concepts have a latency
 * period and can’t be activated whilst they are latent. 2) The activation
 * threshold is dynamic and is adjusted to keep the number of ‘active’ concepts
 * within a manageable range. 3) Some concepts are inhibited (using negative
 * truth values (0.5) as inhibitor). So each cycle all ‘eligible’ concepts are
 * activated, cycles have a fixed time unit (parameter adjustable, currently 13
 * cycles/sec (Human alpha wave freq!)), latency is 8 cycles. Another difference
 * is that I process more than one task and belief per concept per cycle. My
 * system functions more like a neural net than NARS so has different dynamics.
 *
 * Forgetting is a separate process which runs in parallel. When memory starts
 * to get low, the process removes low ‘durability’ items. (My attention
 * allocation is different to Pei’s).  *
 * The latency period simulates the recovery period for neurons whereby a neuron
 * cannot fire after previously firing for the specified recovery period.
 *
 * Each concept records the systemTime when it was last activated. So a concept
 * is latent if the current systemTime(in cycles) minus the last activation time
 * (in cycles) is less then the latency period (e.g. 8 cycles). The latency
 * period is a parameter so can be adjusted. 8 cycles just happen to have given
 * me the best results on my current test data.
 *
 * Each cycle 'All' concepts that are active and not latent fire. By adjusting
 * the activation threshold this number can be quite small even in a very large
 * network.
 *
 * In an earlier version of the system I did use this approach with ConceptBags
 * - however, extracting a non-latent concept was not very efficient. I had to
 * TakeOut() then check the latency - this lead to quite a few misses before
 * getting a usable concept.
 *
 * The agent based approach in place now is much more efficient. Because every
 * concept is an agent it decides whether it needs to fire. Concepts only have
 * the potential to fire if they have received a new task. So again, this limits
 * the number of concepts to fire each cycle.
 *
 * In summary, each cycle, all new tasks are 'dispatched’’ to the relevant
 * concepts and ‘all’ the concepts that are not latent and have an activation
 * level above the dynamic threshold are fired. There is a final check on each
 * concept so that it only fires once it has processed all of its agent messages
 * (Tasks)

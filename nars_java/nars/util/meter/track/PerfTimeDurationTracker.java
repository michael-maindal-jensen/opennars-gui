/**
 * A tracker that tracks time duration with high precision. It uses
 * <code>sun.misc.Perf</code>, a high performance time measurement service.
 * The actual time is calculated as <code>(endTicks - startTicks) * 1000 / frequency</code>.
 * The value is stored as a fraction of milliseconds.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class uses proprietary Sun APIs, therefore it is not
 * guaranteed to work with future versions of the Sun VM, or other VMs. The safest way
 * to use this tracker is to create it using {@link TimeDurationTracker#FACTORY}
 * which safely selects the most precise method of time duration measurement available.
